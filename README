                          Foreign Keyboard Wayland HUD
                          ----------------------------
                          Master a new keyboard layout
                              without looking down


Particularly practical when looking down would be of no help since your physical
keyboard still shows the good old, reliable, comfortable labels on its keys--if
they even are labelled at all, that is.

Currently only displays 한글 characters with some muted QWERTY hints overlaid.


Development --------------------------------------------------------------------

    ./dev <client|server> ....... continuously build and run <client|server>

    Requires gcc, make, pgk-config, all dependencies of base-devel: chances
    are immense that you've got the tools suite already.


Dependencies -------------------------------------------------------------------

  - gtk4-layer-shell

      In order to create panels and other desktop components for Wayland.

  - noto-fonts

      Google's Noto fonts, for its support of a great number of languages.


Wishlist -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - In the HUD, drop GTK4, but don't use Qt either: go raw layer-shell,
    from wayland-protocols (I think?) + cairo.  Do remember to udpate the
    dependencies section afterwards.

  - Currently (probably?) works on X11: am I certain to be okay with going
    Wayland-only just to drop GTK4 and hand-roll the whole shebang?

  - Highlight keypresses

  - Reflect current effective layout in key labels

  - Make some things configurable (at least colours, font)

  - Better finalise production packaging, probably publish to the AUR

Licensing ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    MIT license, do essentially as you please; refer to LICENSE for details.
