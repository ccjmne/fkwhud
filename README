                          Foreign Keyboard Wayland HUD
                          ============================


Get familiar with a new keyboard layout without having to look down.

Particularly practical when looking down would be of no help because your
physical keyboard still shows the good old, reliable, comfortable labels on its
keys—if any labels at all.

Currently only displays 한글 characters with some muted QWERTY hints overlaid.


Development --------------------------------------------------------------------

    make run                                                  build and run once
    fd '.*\.c' | entr -cr -- make run                 continuously build and run

    Requires gcc, make, pgk-config, all dependencies of base-devel: chances are
    immense that you've got the tools suite already.


Dependencies -------------------------------------------------------------------

    - gtk4-layer-shell

        In order to create panels and other desktop components for Wayland.

    - noto-fonts-cjk

        Google's Noto CJK fonts, for 한글 glyphs.
