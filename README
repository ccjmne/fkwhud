                          Foreign Keyboard Wayland HUD
                          ----------------------------
                          Master a new keyboard layout
                              without looking down


Particularly practical when looking down would be of no help when your physical
keyboard still shows the good old, reliable, comfortable labels on its keys--if
any at all.

Currently only displays 한글 characters with some muted QWERTY hints overlaid.


Development --------------------------------------------------------------------

    make run                                             build and run once
    fd '.*\.c' | entr -cr -- make run            continuously build and run

    Requires gcc, make, pgk-config, all dependencies of base-devel: chances
    are immense that you've got the tools suite already.


Dependencies -------------------------------------------------------------------

    - gtk4-layer-shell

        In order to create panels and other desktop components for Wayland.

    - noto-fonts-cjk

        Google's Noto CJK fonts, for 한글 glyphs.


Licensing ----------------------------------------------------------------------
